##About z8e

z8e is the Zooniverse's new translations hub. It supports most of our newer projects and all planned future projects. It is currently in a testing stage and supports [Plankton Portal](http://www.planktonportal.org) and [Space Warps](http://www.spacewarps.org).

Visit the z8e app at http://z8e.herokuapp.com and sign-in with any Google account. We use people's Google emails to keep track of people at the different levels of access to z8e:

- Member of the public
- Trusted translator
- Administrator

These different levels have different types of access to z8e and different powers in the system.

##### Crowdsourced Translations

Anyone can access z8e and contribute translations to any project. This means that we can offer the task of translation to a large number of people as a crowdsourced task.

##### Translators

Translators create translations and can also review the translations of others and accept or reject them.

##### Administrators

The highest level of user can deploy (_push_) translations to the live site. They can also create and update the source file (English) for projects too.

##Using z8e

To start translating, log in and select the project you want to translate. Then select *Translate* underneath the your language.

You'll see the source string to translate and a text box underneath where you can type the new, translated text. When you're done with any string, click 'send' and your translation will be sent to the system for approval.

Trusted translators can *Resolve* translations with a quick *Delete* or *Accept*. These are then saved ready for deployment to the live website.

Administrators can then *Push* changes to the live site and create a *Manifest* to displays the right combination of languages to the project's top bar.
